# SVM-and-Regression-applied-to-Forest-Fires-and-Iris-Flower-Dataset
This project explores the performance of SVM, Kernel Perceptron, Lasso and Ridge Regression algorithms on the iris flower dataset and forest fires dataset.

### What this project is about:

It uses the Lasso and Ridge Regression with varying regularization paramaters to evaluate the datasets and then uses SVMs and Kernel Perceptrons to fit the same datasets.

### What you will need to run this:

* Python 3 interpreter
* Datasets (available in this repo)

### How to run:

* Clone the repo to your local directory
* Verify that the python files are in the same folder, datasets in a folder called data (or you could change the code to use it otherwise)
* Open main.py and run
